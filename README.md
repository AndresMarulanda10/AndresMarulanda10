# Hey! I'm Andrés 👋

I'm a **Software Architect** and **Team Leader** from Bogotá, Colombia, currently working remotely with companies in New York.

I love building things that matter - from quantum ML platforms helping people with visual disabilities to ERP systems that transform small businesses. Right now, I'm leading engineering teams at Galleon, where we've reduced deployment time by 60% and delivered a $550K architecture.

My journey started in international commerce, but I fell in love with code and never looked back. Now I get to work on everything from quantum computing algorithms for the Colombian government to AI recognition systems for hair salons (yes, really!).

## What I'm building with
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Django, Microservices  
**Cloud:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes  
**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Qiskit (quantum computing)  
**Security:** Cybersecurity, Kali Linux, Infrastructure Hardening  

## Currently
- 🏗️ **Software Architect** at Galleon (NYC) - Leading multifunctional engineering teams
- 🎓 **Software Engineering Student** - Finishing my degree while working full-time
- 🧠 **IBM-Certified** in Cybersecurity & Quantum Computing
- 🎤 **Guest Speaker** at Universidad del Externado on AI & Quantum applications

## Some things I've built
**PASIF** - Quantum ML platform for visual accessibility (Government project)  
**Centor** - Open-source ERP for startups  
**Triceo** - AI recognition system for hair salons  
**Ancrar** - Gamified Spanish verb learning app  

## Fun facts about me
* I started in international commerce and somehow ended up doing quantum computing
* I've worked with German foundations on accessibility projects
* I love giving talks about AI and quantum computing to university students
* I believe quantum computing will change everything (and I'm working to make it happen)
* I'm that guy who automates everything - reduced operational overhead by 70% at my current job
