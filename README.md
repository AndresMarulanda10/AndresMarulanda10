### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Carlos Andr√©s**](https://portfolio-andres-marulanda.vercel.app/), a Software Developer and Architect based in Colombia.

I love building scalable cloud architectures and scalable systems and turning complex business challenges into efficient tech solutions. I enjoy exploring the fascinating world of quantum computing and AI while developing full-stack applications.

Outside of code and cloud platforms, you'll find me working on accessibility projects, automating everything I can, or diving deep into quantum algorithms.

#### Fun Facts:
* I've designed architectures worth over $550K while reducing operational costs by 70%
* I work with quantum computing using Qiskit for data analysis
* I speak at universities about AI and Quantum Computing applications
* I'm currently finishing my Software Engineering degree while working full-time
